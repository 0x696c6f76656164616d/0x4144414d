        <h2>Dear Adam 💜</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
        <p>
        I am so happy to be yours again and spend time with you like we used to back in summer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everytime I reminisce on pure moments like those, they provide nothing but solace through hardships.
            I want nothing more than to cultivate that once more, into a form that's greater than ever before.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to be the last partner you ever need to come across. I know I'm not perfect and I won't be able to offer 
            absolutely everything upfront, but I want to try. I want to keep learning along the way to making you happy and
            try to make you less worried within my power. Even when the road is a bit bumpy between us, I still look forward
            to the journey ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loving you taught me many things- it taught me lessons and it blessed me with miracles. If you combine all the pain
            we went through to try to amend our faults, I would go through that many times over if it meant consolidating a future
            with you. From the moment I met you, I knew you weren't going to be an ordinary experience. You were meant to be a long-
            lasting feverdream.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally I was going to just give you a letter embedded in a cute card, but I thought this would be a great way to really
            show you how much you're appreciated. I started coding this on 19/12/2025 and wanted to give myself time to make it perfect.
            I'm not the best web designer because my strengths lie elsewhere, but for what I can do I really tried my best. And I wanted
            to give you a token of appreciation that was mobile- something you could read no matter where you were. And I wanted to deliver
            that in a way that came from who Eryn was- a programmer. My passion for you, and my passion for computer science both come together
            to give you the purest and most raw form of love.
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter where you are, no matter what we go through, you will always be a pinnacle of faith for me. As long as you're here, every 
            pain and suffering is worth blood, sweat, and tears. 
        </p>
        <p>With all my love,<br>Eryn 💕</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic;">P.S. if you look closely at the equation you'll see that some of the terms
            are your birthday (1, 29, 26) :3
        </p>
