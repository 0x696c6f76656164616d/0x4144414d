        <h2>Dear Adam 💜</h2>
        <div class="letter-content">
        <p>
        I am so happy to be yours again and spend time with you like we used to back in summer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everytime I reminisce on pure moments like those, they provide nothing but solace through hardships.
            I want nothing more than to cultivate that once more, into a form that's greater than ever before.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to be the last partner you ever need to come across. I know I'm not perfect and I won't be able to offer 
            absolutely everything upfront, but I want to try. I want to keep learning along the way to making you happy and
            try to make you less worried within my power. Even when the road is a bit bumpy between us, I still look forward
            to the journey ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loving you taught me many things- it taught me lessons and it blessed me with miracles. If you combine all the pain
            we went through to try to amend our faults, I would go through that many times over if it meant consolidating a future
            with you. From the moment I met you, I knew you weren't going to be an ordinary experience. You were meant to be a long-
            lasting feverdream.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally I was going to just give you a letter embedded in a cute card, but I thought this would be a great way to really
            show you how much you're appreciated. I started coding this on 19/12/2025 and wanted to give myself time to make it perfect.
            I'm not the best web designer because my strengths lie elsewhere, but for what I can do I really tried my best. And I wanted
            to give you a token of appreciation that was mobile- something you could read no matter where you were. And I wanted to deliver
            that in a way that came from who Eryn was- a programmer. My passion for you, and my passion for computer science both come together
            to give you the purest and most raw form of love.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I started to love you, I knew you weren't someone for my development, you were someone to give my finale. I dont want to lose what we have, I dont want my history with you to end up as a resume for someone else. 
            I dont want to unlearn your favourite color to make space to start asking someone theirs. How I feel for you is how protagonists feel in fantasy books when they survive inhumane torture in the name of love. 
            When I say I cant live without you, I mean that my quality of life becomes noticeably dull. Life becomes better. Suddenly, buttering my toast and telling you about it later sounds better than eating toast alone. 
            Suddenly, going to sleep with you on the other side sounds better than preparing myself for dreams where I can only fantasize what is my reality now. 
            Suddenly, going out to see you sounds a lot better than taking myself on dates wishing you were by my side. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I want 2026 to be a year where tears form from joy and reunification, not tears of regret and grief. I want our lives to be intertwined, having the luxury of being involved with one another, 
            than the pain of observing from afar. I dont want you to be "the one that got away", I dont want you to be the story I tell people when they ask me what love feels like. 
            I want to be able to show people what its like with you by my side. Your kisses wouldn't be a fragment in my mind, your kisses would be an everyday occurrence, 
            a ritual full of intangible benefits. Your fingertips wouldn't be a lingering phantom, but a safe abode I can retreat to when the world becomes hurtful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want you to be able to look someone in the eye and declare our years of dedication down the line. Not that you found a new date with the help of your friend 
            who doesnt know that you hate the smell of cigarettes and dont use anything other than skim milk. 
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter the distance, youre always within reach of my arms when needed. No matter where you are in my life, present or not, ill always find you. 
            You know when they say to be loved is to be seen? To innately know you, remember your dislikes and dislikes, have pop up thoughts like "adam wouldn't do that" 
            "adam would love this", I fear that even if we parted ways, id find remnants of you everywhere as a subtle reminder that youll never leave my heart. 
            ill find you at a pub with cider, ill find you in every ham and cheese sandwich I see, ill find you when a disoc8 song comes on shuffle, ill find you when someone mentions plastic memories
        </p>
        <p>
            There's not a single thing I would change about you. All the days leading up to me writing this have been filled with nothing but blissful longing for you.  
            When I envision a future, youre the integral piece to making a fever dream a lucid reality. When im doing the washing, im doing our washing. 
            When im showering, we're showering together, when im looking at food menus online, im asking you what you also want. When i come home from work, you're there waiting for me.  
            That's the life I want, that's the life I'll fight to have.  Because life otherwise is only half complete and wrong to live in isolation
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter where you are, no matter what we go through, you will always be a pinnacle of faith for me. As long as you're here, every 
            pain and suffering is worth blood, sweat, and tears. 
        </p>
        <p>With all my love,<br>Eryn 💕</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic;">P.S. if you look closely at the equation you'll see that some of the terms
            are your birthday (1, 29, 26) :3
